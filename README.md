## Introduction
This project is a Pathfinding Visualizer built using C++ and the SFML library. It visually demonstrates howBreadth-First Search (BFS) explores a grid to find the shortest path between two points. The visualizer allows users to see the algorithm in action, tracing the explored path and highlighting the final path found.

## Features
- Visual demonstration of BFS.
- Interactive grid where users can place start and end points as well as obstacles.
- Step-by-step exploration of the grid, highlighting the current cell being explored.
- Path tracing from the end point back to the start point once the algorithm completes.

### Dependencies
- SFML 2.5.1 or newer
